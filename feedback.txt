  Issues:
    1. **Variable Name Error**: A typo introduces a bug where the function `fibonacci()` is called with `mn` instead of `n`.
    2. **Code Formatting Redundancy**: Changes made do not improve the structure, readability, or maintainability of the function.
    3. **Lack of Validation**: Input validation for `n` is still missing, potentially leading to unintended behavior or crashes (e.g., if the user enters a negative number or non-integer).
    
  Suggestions:
    1. Fix the variable name error (`mn` should be replaced with `n` to match the function signature).
    2. Consider refactoring the hardcoded input and function call (e.g., move the input logic outside the script for better reusability or use a `main()` function).
    3. Add error handling or input validation to ensure `n` is a non-negative integer.

Evaluation and Summary:

The changes in this commit do not improve the code quality. While the shift in indentation appears to signify no functional changes in the core Fibonacci implementation, the introduction of a typing error (`fibonacci(mn)` instead of `fibonacci(n)`) creates a critical bug, rendering the code non-functional. Additionally, existing concerns around input validation are not addressed.

To improve this script:
- Correct the variable name error immediately.
- Modularize the code for enhanced clarity and maintainability.
- Add proper input validation to avoid runtime issues.
