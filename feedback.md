**Commit ID:** 695028f  

**Issues Detected:**  
1. **Security Vulnerability:** User-supplied `diff` data is embedded in the dynamic `prompt` string without sanitization or escaping, which may lead to injection or tampering risks.  
   **Suggestion:** Sanitize user input and avoid directly embedding large strings into prompts for external services.  
2. **Best Practices:** Avoid redundant f-string reassignment for `prompt` (`prompt = f"""..."""` is redundant in this context).  
   **Suggestion:** Improve clarity by rewriting or removing unnecessary assignments.

The commit introduces a security vulnerability. Specifically, the `Evil.__eq__` method uses `exec()` to execute arbitrary code, which poses a severe security risk. This can lead to code injection attacks and unauthorized actions. Usage of `exec()` should generally be avoided or carefully sanitized with strict constraints.
