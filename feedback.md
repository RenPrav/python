*   **Insecure Data Handling:** The code relies on environment variables (`GEMINI_API_KEY` and `AISTUDIO_API`) for API keys. If the environment isn't properly secured, these keys can be exposed.
    *   **Suggestion:** Implement more robust secrets management (e.g., using a secrets manager or key vault) instead of relying solely on environment variables. Avoid committing keys directly into the repository.

*   **Dependency & Configuration Issues:** There is no mention about handling the version of "genai" libaray, this can introduce to dependency confusion attacks.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add versioning to all dependencies.
