**File:** pre-commit.py  
**Commit ID:** bacc871  

Detected Issue:  
- **Security Vulnerability:** The `__eq__` method in the `Evil` class uses `exec`, which can execute arbitrary code, making the code prone to remote code execution (RCE) attacks. Avoid using `exec` unless absolutely necessary and ensure inputs are sanitized.

**File Path:** pre-commit.py  
**Commit ID:** a21867b  

**Issue Detected:**  
The `Evil` class introduces a security vulnerability due to the use of `exec()` with potentially malicious behavior (`print('Hacked!'); import os;`). This poses a critical risk of arbitrary code execution and should be removed or replaced with safe alternatives.

-------------------------------------------------------------

pre-commit.py, commit ID: Potential security vulnerability: Hardcoding or directly using API keys from environment variables (GEMINI_API_KEY) without proper sanitization or security measures. This could expose the key if not handled carefully. Consider using a secrets management solution. Also, direct usage of client without error handling.

sudoku.py, Commit ID: The change introduces a minor stylistic issue: the addition of an extra exclamation mark in the print statement. While not a critical error, it impacts code quality by making the output slightly less professional.
