Introduces a serious **security vulnerability**: The `Evil` class uses `exec()` with a dangerous and unrestricted command, enabling arbitrary code execution. This poses a major risk, as it could potentially allow malicious actions, including importing harmful modules or manipulating the environment.

The removal of the `Evil` class addresses a potential security vulnerability. However, verify that no similar insecure patterns remain elsewhere. **No Issues in newly introduced code.**

**Response:** The addition of the `Evil` class introduces a major security vulnerability. The use of `exec` with hardcoded commands (`exec("print('Hacked!'); import os;")`) is highly dangerous as it can execute arbitrary and potentially malicious code. This violates best practices for secure and maintainable code.
