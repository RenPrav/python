The provided feedback thoroughly identifies key problems within the changes, highlighting critical flaws, such as the introduction of a **Code Injection** vulnerability via `exec()` and insufficient input handling. However, to clarify further:

1. **Security Issues**:
   - The use of `exec()` introduces a **severe Code Injection vulnerability**.
   - Lack of user input sanitization makes the code unsafe when exposed to untrusted inputs.

2. **Logic & Best Practices**:
   - Misuse of variables (`mn` instead of `n`) introduces a major bug.
   - Lack of proper exception handling for invalid inputs makes the program prone to crashes.

3. **Code Quality**:
   - No significant improvements. Instead, code quality worsens due to unsafe practices and missing input validation.

**CONCISE SUMMARY:**  
The changes in this commit introduce a critical **Code Injection vulnerability** (via `exec()`) and worsen code quality by adding poor input handling and a major typing error. Immediate removal of `exec()` and correction of these issues are imperative.
**No Issues**

The changes in `fibonacci.py` appear to remove a potential vulnerability introduced by the `exec()` statement in the original code. The following observations were made:

1. **Security Improvements**:
   - The removal of `exec()` mitigates the risk of **Code Injection**. The original usage could be exploited if malicious input were somehow passed, leading to arbitrary code execution.

2. **Memory & Performance**:
   - No evidence of memory leaks or performance bottlenecks introduced.
   - Loop logic and variable usage are consistent and efficient.

3. **Logic & Best Practices**:
   - Code is straightforward and follows best practices. There are no poor exception handling mechanisms, race conditions, or weak cryptographic concerns.

4. **Dependency & Configuration**:
   - No changes related to dependencies or misconfigurations.
   - No debug mode or settings introduced.

5. **Maintainability**:
   - Code is clean and readable. The removal of `exec()` enhances code maintainability and clarity.

### Summary:
The removal of `exec()` eliminates a potential security risk, improving the quality and safety of the code.

NO ISSUES

-------------------------------------------------------------

**ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

1. **Injection Attacks:**
   - The code directly takes user input (`input()`) for the number of terms without validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if non-integer inputs or malicious payloads are provided.

2. **Syntax Errors:**
   - The strings `sdkfsd` and `dfd` at the end of the code appear to be invalid syntax or accidental artifacts, leading to a syntax error when executed.

3. **Logic & Best Practices:**
   - Missing exception handling for invalid or unexpected inputs (e.g., strings, negative numbers). This could crash the program unexpectedly.

4. **Performance Concerns:**
   - The code has an **O(n)** time complexity and **O(1)** space complexity, which is efficient for small values of `n`. However, if `n` is very large, it could cause resource exhaustion, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.

5. **Maintainability Issues:**
   - There is no proper documentation or function description (missing docstrings).
   - Unnecessary and unrelated characters (`sdkfsd`, `dfd`) reduce code quality and may confuse readers.

**SUMMARY:**
- **Security Issues:** Input validation missing, potential for unexpected crashes.
- **Syntax Errors:** Invalid syntax due to stray strings (`sdkfsd`, `dfd`).
- **Best Practices:** Lack of exception handling and documentation.
   
**Recommendations to Improve Code Quality:**
- Validate `input()` to ensure it is a positive integer.
- Remove stray strings (`sdkfsd`, `dfd`).
- Add proper exception handling for invalid inputs.
- Include a docstring for the function to explain its purpose.
**NO ISSUES**
