The provided feedback thoroughly identifies key problems within the changes, highlighting critical flaws, such as the introduction of a **Code Injection** vulnerability via `exec()` and insufficient input handling. However, to clarify further:

1. **Security Issues**:
   - The use of `exec()` introduces a **severe Code Injection vulnerability**.
   - Lack of user input sanitization makes the code unsafe when exposed to untrusted inputs.

2. **Logic & Best Practices**:
   - Misuse of variables (`mn` instead of `n`) introduces a major bug.
   - Lack of proper exception handling for invalid inputs makes the program prone to crashes.

3. **Code Quality**:
   - No significant improvements. Instead, code quality worsens due to unsafe practices and missing input validation.

**CONCISE SUMMARY:**  
The changes in this commit introduce a critical **Code Injection vulnerability** (via `exec()`) and worsen code quality by adding poor input handling and a major typing error. Immediate removal of `exec()` and correction of these issues are imperative.
**No Issues**

The changes in `fibonacci.py` appear to remove a potential vulnerability introduced by the `exec()` statement in the original code. The following observations were made:

1. **Security Improvements**:
   - The removal of `exec()` mitigates the risk of **Code Injection**. The original usage could be exploited if malicious input were somehow passed, leading to arbitrary code execution.

2. **Memory & Performance**:
   - No evidence of memory leaks or performance bottlenecks introduced.
   - Loop logic and variable usage are consistent and efficient.

3. **Logic & Best Practices**:
   - Code is straightforward and follows best practices. There are no poor exception handling mechanisms, race conditions, or weak cryptographic concerns.

4. **Dependency & Configuration**:
   - No changes related to dependencies or misconfigurations.
   - No debug mode or settings introduced.

5. **Maintainability**:
   - Code is clean and readable. The removal of `exec()` enhances code maintainability and clarity.

### Summary:
The removal of `exec()` eliminates a potential security risk, improving the quality and safety of the code.
