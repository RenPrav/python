**Commit ID:** 54dabf9da2c1498689c1b8124e79f5448670ffba

**Issues:**

*   **Code Injection:** The `Evil` class in the original code contained an `exec` call within the `__eq__` method. This is a major security vulnerability as it allows arbitrary code execution if an instance of this class is compared to anything. The commit removes this vulnerability.
